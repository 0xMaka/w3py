# w3py
- Various scripts, and examples written for users while working as Sushi support.
- - No promises on versioning, everything should be good but the web3 library has received some updates in the past couple of years that these can be from.

Will add as found, where appropriate, and can hopefully be of an assist to some.

> **NOTE** The repo root directory is getting very crowded but I don't want to make a sweeping change that might have any negatively effect, so will be creating a new branch that should be better organised, and at will at the same time make an effort to update code broken by changes to the web3 library. 
If appears a much better structure without much downside can look to keep an archive and make the switch.
Always love to see examples be of use, and often happy to take requests if you might be struggling with something.
