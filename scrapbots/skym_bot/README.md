basic bot example

        NOTE: Bot makes no check for profitability, only difference. Bot scans a single pool. 
        Bot makes no attempt to optimise cycles and would not be competative.
        To make competative bots consider writing computationally expensive modules in c,
        or rust, and using python as the glue language.
        Consider strategies for gas, and pool analysis.
        Consider running an own node or looking into a service such as block native,
        so to back run the mem pool as opposed to on chain balance changes.
